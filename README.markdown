Synopsis
--------

The Ruby CookieJar is a library to help manage client-side cookies in pure Ruby. It enables parsing and setting of cookie headers, alternating between multiple 'jars' of cookies at one time (such as having a set of cookies for each browser or thread), and supports persistence of the cookies in a JSON string.
